<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my <strong>favorite</strong> herbal vinegar. 
    It's an amazingly effective remedy for 
    staying healthy in the winter and keeping 
    colds and flu at bay. It's actually delicious! 
    Use it as a salad dressing, but be sure to save 
    some for medicinal purposes.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4-5 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>3-4 tablespoons freshly grated gingerroot</li>
    <li>3-4 tablespoons freshly grated horseradish root</li>
    <li>Apple cider vinegar (preferably unpasteurized)</li>
    <li>Honey</li>
    <li>Cayenne powder</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the onion, garlic, ginger, and horseradish
        in a widemouthed glass quart jar and add enough warmed
        apple cider vinegar to cover them. (Warming the vinegar allows
        it to more actively draw the properties out of the herbs.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Place in a warm spot (near a sunny window is fine) and let sit 
        for 3 to 4 weeks. 
    </li>
    <li>Strain, then discard the spent herbs. Now the 
        fun part: Add honey and cayenne to taste. The finished product should
        taste lively, hot, pungent, and sweet.
    </li>
</ol>
