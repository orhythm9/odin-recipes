<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This is a great recipe for a healthy, healing herb paste.
    Sage dominates the flavor of this pungent, strong pesto.
    You can use less sage if you find it overpowering.
    Of course, if you have fresh wild herbs such as dandelion greens,
    chickweed, and plantain, add those as well for their healing nutrients.
